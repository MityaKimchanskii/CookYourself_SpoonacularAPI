Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
When you open the application, you are greeted by a welcome screen, which consists of three viewcontrollers. 
Then by pressing the close button, the home screen opens, where you can see a joke that is randomly called 
from the server.  The search viewcontroller consists of a search field and a table, which is filled in by 
the keyword corresponding to the query.  Each recipe can be opened and detailed instructions can be viewed 
on the details screen, and here you can also add a recipe to your favorite and save it to RealmDB.  To view 
a list of your favorite dishes, go to the favorite viewcontroller.  A dish can be removed from the table.  
You can see as well detailed instructions.  Data is pulled from RealmDB.  If the server request limit is 
exceeded, you will see attention message.
